## Student Registration Application for JAVA I final group project

Attached Zipfile is an Eclipse project. It can be run in Eclipse, however, it was designed to run in console.

## How to run the app 

1. unzip the folder in a location of your choosing.
2. At this point your can import the application into Eclipse if so desired
3. Alternatively you can run this directly in your console by opennig the command line console (recommeded due to console clearning methods that work only in console), and navigating to the project folder called StudentApplicationApp. From this folder run the command -> java  StudentClassRegistration

```markdown
C:\Path_to_student_registration_app\StudentApplicationApp> java  StudentClassRegistration


```

NOTE: to be able to run the application you will need a password and a username since the application has logging and validation capability. All passwords and usernames (all are fake obviously :)) are stored in studentdata.txt file.
